# Exploring Rails

It is a simple Rails application with Tailwind, which I am exploring and studying to learn about MVC (Model-View-Controller) in this wonderful framework.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

- Did you install the latest version of `<Ruby>` 
- Do you have a machine running `<Windows / Linux / Mac>`

## ðŸš€ Using the repository
1- Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:pedrosrc/Exploring-Rails.git
```

2- Install the dependecies

```
bundle install
```
3- Run the migrations
```
rails db:migrate
```

4- Run the porject

```
rails server
```


As mentioned, this is a study repository where I applied the CRUD method to this application for Articles. In it, I was able to explore methods such as Turbo and its views. I found their behavior very interesting, and it is a small step towards something grand within Ruby on Rails
